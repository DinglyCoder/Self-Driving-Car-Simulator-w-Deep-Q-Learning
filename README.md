This project was made as part of the Deep Learning Deep Dive online course with Inspirit AI. As part of this course I learned many Deep Learning algortihms. 

My final project was to implement Deep Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train a simulated 2D car to stay within the confines of a winding road.

A video explanation of the project can be seen below:
